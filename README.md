#WWWWH SVG
## Who What When Why? HOW? svg
### Ben Marks


## Why should I care about SVG?
- They are _scalable_ -- for all you responsive nuts out there
- They are _XML_
    - easy to understand
- They can be manipulated _just like any other tag_
    - CSS -- YES!
    - Javascript
    - and Internal animations!
- They can hold text
- change width/height to percent or vh!
- change viewBox to what it needs to be for your view. This might be a good use of JS...


**Note: The value of a pixel depends on the view box**

# build an app for this too. just press buttons.

#### Agenda

- ~~History (10-15)~~
- Use cases:
    - Good at:
        - responsiveness
        - scalability (think reuse)
        - simple animations
        - building graphics on the fly.
    - Bad at:
        - IE and Edge. Everyone else is not ok. There are shivs available
        - canvas-like activities
        - complicated animations
- Format and structure (15-20)
    - call up a "control file"
    - Read more about tags!
    - `<svg>`
        - attributes
    - `<g>`
    - shape and path elements
    - animation elements
- Usage (15-20)
    - tied into the above explanation... then tie it together with a big thing.
    - make a site to contain all this!
